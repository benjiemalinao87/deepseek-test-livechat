this is a texting app using twilio.

what you should write in @lessons_learn.md any lessons learned when you successfully fix the issue. do not use this to log progress and roadmap. there is @progress.md for that. and roadmap in @roadmap.md.


- refer to @README.md and @progress.md for solving the inbound and outbound text.
- stay consistent with the design of like Mac OS design philosophy. 
- do not create file if already existed.
- as much as possible for better integration with all part of the app, seperate each part of the UI in seperate file.
- create a new file called lessons_learn.md log there what you learn about fixing the bug. always log there after successful debugging. log it without me asking
- once completed a feature please update @progress.md what what changes or features being done and check of @roadmap.md


# Error Fixing
- Consider multiple possible causes before deciding. Do not jump to conclusions
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- Always verify the fix
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a web search to find the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process
- Understand requirements completely before starting
- Plan the next steps in detail
- Use an @README.md file to define the following:
  1. Project Overview: Purpose of the project and a summary of its goals
  2. Core Functionalities: A breakdown of what the app should do
  3. Docs and Libraries: Documentation or tools that will be referenced
  4. Current File Structure: A snapshot of existing files to provide clarity
5. once finish building the feature, if it is succesully, update the file progress.md, if not exist, please create it.

Write each step in the process as simple and precise prompts.
Test each functionality after implementation.

# Automatically update documentation files after each significant change:
- progress.md: Track completed features and improvements
- lessons_learn.md: Document technical insights and solutions
- roadmap.md: Update progress and adjust future plans
- instructions.md: Maintain project overview and requirements
