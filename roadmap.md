# LiveChat App Roadmap

## Current Limitations and Scaling Challenges

### Frontend Limitations
- Messages are stored in React state (memory) without pagination
- All messages are loaded at once, which would slow down the UI
- No message virtualization for long conversation histories
- No message persistence across page reloads

### Backend Concerns
- No database implementation for message storage
- Socket.IO connections might need clustering for high concurrent users
- No rate limiting on SMS sending
- No message queue system for handling high volume
- Memory usage would grow with active connections

## Scaling Solutions Roadmap

To handle thousands of conversations, we need to implement the following:

### Phase 1: Data Persistence & Performance
1. Add PostgreSQL database for message persistence
   - Store message history
   - User conversations
   - Contact information
   
2. Implement frontend optimizations
   - Message pagination
   - Message virtualization for long conversations
   - Lazy loading of conversation history

### Phase 2: System Scalability
3. Add Redis for:
   - Socket session management
   - Caching frequently accessed conversations
   - Rate limiting implementation

4. Message Queue Implementation
   - Set up Redis/RabbitMQ for SMS processing
   - Handle high volume message sending
   - Implement retry mechanisms

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Monitoring
5. Horizontal Scaling
   - Implement socket server clustering
   - Load balancing configuration
   - Container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes)

6. Monitoring & Maintenance
   - Set up proper monitoring systems
   - Implement auto-scaling
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Error tracking and alerting

## Current Status
The current setup is optimized for prototype and small-scale usage. Moving to production with high user load will require implementing the above architectural changes in phases.
